# The dictionary is another Python data structure. It's not a sequence type and it is mutable.

# Its a look-a-like of JSON
# It stores data in a key-pair value.
# It stores a key and a value corresponding to the key for easy accessing of the data

# Example:
dictionary = {"cat": "Hello", "dog": "china"}

phone_num = {"boss": 12345345345, "Suzy": 23092398743}
