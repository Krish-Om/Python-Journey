# check the state of your bit


# x&1 = x
# x & 0= 0

# set your bit
# x|1 = 1
# x|0 = x
#
# negate your bit
# x ^ 1 =~x
# x ^ 0 = x
#
# Note: way of right shifting and left shifting in pyhon

# 17 >> 1 → 17 // 2 (17 floor-divided by 2 to the power of 1) → 8 (shifting to the right by one bit is the same as integer division by two)
# 17 << 2 → 17 * 4 (17 multiplied by 2 to the power of 2) → 68 (shifting to the left by two bits is the same as integer multiplication by four)
